                        Welcome to my website.

                        I am an animal portrait artist who completed Merlin, my <Link to={'/examples/merlin'}>first drawing</Link>,
                        22 years ago.  All my portraits are completed using pencil for a beautifully detailed drawing.

                    <p>
                        I love being able to capture the unique character of each animal I draw, from the texture of the fur to the detail of the eyes and nose.

                    <p>
                        It's very rewarding to be able to make a plain piece of paper come to life.
                        But the most satisfying aspect of what I do is hearing from my happy customers and knowing I have created something very special for them.
